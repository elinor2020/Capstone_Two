# Capstone_Two
Seoul Bike Share Program
The problem to be solved is the prediction of bike count required per day and at a given collection of locations for the stable supply of rental bikes. The data set is concerned with rental bikes as a ride sharing program. There are 8760 instances and 14 attributes (features). The features are aspects of the weather, the number of bikes rented per hour and date information. The data was acquired from the Machine Learning Repository, Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems, U.C. Irvine. The deliverables will be code, a project report, and a slide deck located in a GitHub repository.
